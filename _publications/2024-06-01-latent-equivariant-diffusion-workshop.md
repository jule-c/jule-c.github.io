This workshop paper presents early work on incorporating latent conditioning mechanisms into equivariant diffusion models for structure-based molecular generation, laying the groundwork for the later journal publication.

## Key Contributions

- **Latent Space Engineering**: Initial development of latent conditioning mechanisms for molecular generation
- **Structure Integration**: Early approaches to incorporating protein structure information
- **Proof of Concept**: Demonstration of improved generation quality through latent conditioning
- **Community Engagement**: Presentation of ideas to the AI in drug discovery community

## Workshop Impact

This presentation at the International Workshop on AI in Drug Discovery helped establish connections with the broader research community and provided valuable feedback that informed the development of the full journal paper. The workshop format allowed for in-depth discussions about the technical challenges and opportunities in equivariant molecular generation.

## Technical Approach

The work explores:
- Efficient latent representations of molecular and protein features
- Conditioning mechanisms that preserve equivariance properties
- Integration with existing structure-based drug design workflows
- Evaluation metrics specific to structure-based molecular generation

This workshop contribution represents an important step in the development of practical AI tools for structure-based drug discovery.
