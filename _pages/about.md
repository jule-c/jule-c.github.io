Welcome to my personal academic website! I am Julian Cremer, a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Pfizer, where I focus on AI for Drug Discovery and AI for Science in general. My research combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques with computational chemistry to accelerate the development of new therapeutic compounds.

## Research Focus

My work centers on developing and applying advanced AI methods to solve challenging problems in drug discovery:

### Equivariant Graph Neural Networks
I develop neural network architectures that respect the fundamental symmetries of molecular systems, enabling more accurate and data-efficient models for molecular property prediction and toxicity assessment.

### Generative Chemistry
Using state-of-the-art generative models including diffusion models and flow matching, I create novel molecular structures with desired properties. My work includes:
- **PILOT**: Pocket-conditioned de novo ligand generation with multi-objective guidance
- **FLOWR**: Flow matching for structure-aware ligand generation
- Target-aware molecular design with importance sampling

### Structure-Based Drug Discovery
I leverage 3D protein-ligand interactions to guide the rational design of drug molecules, combining structural biology insights with AI-driven optimization.

## Key Contributions

My research has resulted in several high-impact publications in top-tier journals and conferences:

- **Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Toxicity Prediction** (Chemical Research in Toxicology, 2023) - Developed novel architectures for predicting molecular toxicity with improved accuracy and interpretability.

- **PILOT: Equivariant Diffusion for Pocket-Conditioned De Novo Ligand Generation** (Chemical Science, 2024) - Introduced a groundbreaking approach for generating drug-like molecules that fit specific protein binding sites.

- **Navigating the Design Space of Equivariant Diffusion-Based Generative Models** (arXiv, 2023) - Comprehensive study on the theoretical foundations and practical applications of equivariant generative models in chemistry.

## Professional Background

At Pfizer, I work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and pharmaceutical research, developing computational tools that accelerate the discovery of new medicines. My role involves:

- Leading research projects in AI-driven drug discovery
- Collaborating with medicinal chemists and biologists
- Publishing research in top-tier scientific venues
- Mentoring junior researchers and students
