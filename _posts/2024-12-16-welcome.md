## How to Create New Posts

1. Create a new file in the `_posts` folder
2. Name it following the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-post.md`
3. Add the front matter (the content between `---` lines at the top)
4. Write your content in Markdown

## Front Matter Example

```yaml

```

## Markdown Basics

You can use **bold**, *italic*, and `code` formatting.

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Math (if enabled)

You can include math equations: $E = mc^2$

### Images

```markdown
![Alt text](/assets/images/your-image.jpg)
```

Happy blogging! 🚀
